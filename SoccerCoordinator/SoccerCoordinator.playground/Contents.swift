 MORE ADVANCED TOOLS:
    - Rather than using [String:String], it would be better to use [String:AnyObject] so 
        that the properties can hold values of the following types:
            "playerName": String
            "heightInInches": Int
            "hasSoccerExperience": Bool
            "guardianNames": String
        * Using [String:AnyObject] would require casting AnyObject to the proper value and
            unwrapping optionals, which isn't in the Toolbox available to me for this project
    - Instead of using a Dictionary type, creating a struct for SoccerPlayer with the 
        properties being the keys in the Dictionary would be better
    - Rather than typing in all the data from SoccerPlayerInfo, it would be better to read 
        the file into the playground, extract the data from that file, and build a Soccer
        Player Array from that data

 MORE ADVANCED TOOLS:
    - Given we're using a [String:String] type for soccerPlayer, the as keyword would be

    - Using a custom Comparable type (struct or class) for Soccer Player where experience,
        and then height, determines their sort order instead of a Dictionary would be even
        more useful:
            * Wouldn't have to deal with unwrapping Optionals of values we know for sure exist
            * Could simply call sort() on the array of Soccer Players to sort by experience
                and height

 SORT EXPERIENCED PLAYERS INTO TEAMS BY HEIGHT
    - GOALS:
        1. Evenly divide experienced players among Sharks, Dragons, and Raptors
        2. Make the average heights of each team as close to each other as possible given above constraint
    - METHODOLOGY:
        Experienced players have already been sorted by height in ascending order. Thus, for every consecutive
        three players, player_n["heightInInches"] <= player_n+1["heightInInches"] <= player_n+2["heightInInches"].
        The total number of experienced players is divisible by 3, so each team should get the same number of
        experienced players.
 
        I am going to consider a single iteration to be when three players in a row have been placed on a team.
        With every iteration, each team has a single player placed on its team. The order in which the three teams
        receive a player is determined by their average heights after the previous iteration is complete. The team
        with the largest average receives the first player because that player has the smallest height of all the
        players in this iteration. Likewise, the team with the second-largest average receives the second player,
        and the team with the smallest average receives the last player (the player with the largest height).
 
        For this particular algorithm, when two or more teams have the same average, the following conditions are used:
            - Raptors have priority over Dragons and Sharks
            - Dragons have priority over Sharks
        These conditions should not influence the effectiveness of the algorithm.

/*
 MORE ADVANCED TOOLS:
    - An enum for the team names would be useful for populating the orderByHeightDesc Array
    - Tools to implement a sort method for the teams:
        * Creating a custom Comparable type for Soccer Team where number of experienced players,
            and then average height, determines their sort order
        * Recursion (if I want to make my own sort function)

/*
 NOTE: The sorting method below works for a small number of teams, but it requires switching on
 a tuple with n*(n-1)/2 Bool values for n! cases and a default to deal with the cases that
 can't occur, where n is the number of teams. That gets large pretty quickly as n increases,
 so a different sorting method should be implemented for a large number of teams.
